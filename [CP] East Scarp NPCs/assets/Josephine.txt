Lewis gives Josephine a tour of the town and she has a series of events that all trigger on various days (so as not to overload the player).

Lewis and her admire the museum, she compliments the architecture.
He invites her inside and introduces her to Gunther, how is his charming self and makes her giggle and blush a little.
Gunther escorts her on a tour of the place, and her response varies depending on how many items have been donated:
< 40 - she comments on how bare it is, to which Lewis tells her of the scoundrel that stole all the artifacts.
40+ - she comments on how it's rather impressive, but makes some sort of throwaway comment about Zuzu's Museum.
Complete: she admires it, then suggests that she could donate paintings for the walls.
"Oh, this place certainly has appeal, but the walls are so bare! Oh, I know! I'll speak to my good friend (artist name) to donate a few pieces."

Leah is showing Josephine her latest work, and gives a fairly indepth explanation on what it means to her. (maybe the work could be a temp actor, and it could be outside her house).
Josephine makes some fairly banal compliments, then comments that  she would love to purchase it, as it would add a delightfully rustic touch to her conservatory.
Leah is not impressed.



Oliver:
FArmer walks in on Oliver telling his friend about Lexi.
She doesn't believe him, believes the photos are fake.
Oliver gets grumpy when challenged by farmer.
Friend jokingly shows photographs to her aunt who is reporter for 'Cryptozoology Today'.
Her aunt Kataryna has seen the photo and wishes to investigate.


Farmer walks in on Oliver on a video call with someone called Kataryna. It soon becomes evident that she's a reporter for a tabloid called 'Cryptozoology Today'.
